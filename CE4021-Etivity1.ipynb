For the sake of this example we will fire our ball within a vacuum (i.e. it is not effected by air currents, wind resistance etc). The following equation is a polynomial that represents the vertical displacement ($ h $) as a function of time ($ t $) with respect to the initial velocity ($ V_{iy} $), and acceleration/deceleration due to gravity ($ g $).\n",
