    "\"Calculus is the mathematical study of change..... It has two major branches: differential calculus (concerning rates of change and slopes of curves) and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under curves)...\" (__Kadry, S 2014__).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this E-tivity I shall concentrate on differential calculas as this is the focus of the task.  Differential calculus can be explained by looking at the rates of change functions.  Take distance, speed and acceleration, if a distance s (from a start of 0 for instance), the derivative of d with respect to time t is the change in distance for the change in time, otherwise known as speed!  If we take speed and calculate its change with respect to t, is is the change in speed for hte change in time, otherwise known as acceleration.  Each derivative describes the function preceding it in respect to a moment in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculus is not meant for computing average speeds (__rich L. Rohde, et al 2012__) Derivatives are considered to quantify an instantaneous rate of change, where the change in distance or speed is with respect to a tiny (approaching 0 amount of change).  This allows for precise calculations of the rate of change of a function at a point in time.\n",

    "I went with a design choice based around dealing with the polynomial in the a dictionary and dealing with the different elements in terms of the power rule.  My first design (not here) was extermely manual and only worked with up to x^9, meaning as I manually entered what I wanted to happend depending on where the values were in the dictionary.  this version is more versitile as it ignores order and splits the value of the power and cooefficent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitely the hardest element was the parsing, using regex this would have been a lot easier however this was not the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivation part, using the for loop on the key and value pairs, I think is an elegant solution to the problem as it does efficently does the differentation and keeps the value in a dictionary form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing back into the new polynomial was equally tricky as the parsing in comparsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaulation section of a polynomial, was again a for loop for a value of x summed, which worked well.  I have carried this out both connected to the main exercise (function 1) but also, left it to evulate from dictionary forms of polynomials for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare your approach to alternative (peer) approaches.\n",
    "Reading through the forums I defintely noted more attention to detail on the input and messages to the user, Peter O'Mahonys was very well implemented and this made me go back.  I also took a second (and third look at my testing) but in the range of tests carried out and the display of the results.\n",

    "- Clearly describe how you have used your peers' work/input and how this has affected your own understanding / insights.\n",

    "Originally I went down the import re route but thanks to the forum I had that explained.  looking at some of the other solution I defintely went back and looked at my original solution to the problem as it was not good enough.  \n",

    "Abstract: Calculus is the mathematical study of change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of operations and their application to solving equations. It has two major branches: differential calculus (concerning rates of change and slopes of curves) and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under curves); these two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit. Calculus has widespread uses in science, economics, and engineering and can solve many problems that algebra alone cannot.\n",
