    "A polynomial is a mathematical equation consisting of variables and coefficients. A polynomial can have any number of coefficients and variables, and the variables can have any order of power that is a positive integer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Polynomials are equations that can be used to describe linear processes is one that represents a ball being fired directly up into the air, also known as the \"equation for vertical motion\". For the sake of this example we will fire our ball within a vacuum (i.e. it is not effected by air currents, wind resistance etc). The following equation is a polynomial that represents the vertical displacement ($ h $) as a function of time ($ t $) with respect to the initial velocity ($ V_{iy} $), and acceleration/deceleration due to gravity ($ g $).\n",
