    " \n",
    " #### Approach:\n",
    "  - The approach I have taken makes use of the Power Law for calculating derivatives and the dictionary data structure in Python to facilitate efficient iteration including when large exponents are present\n",
    "  - The key steps are first to require the input be provided in the form of a dictionary where keys represent the exponent and the values represent the coefficient. An alternative would be to store the coefficients in a list where the index of the list represents the corresponding exponent. Both approaches provide a tidy way for iterative processing of polynomials however when considering the example of 3x^1000 (ie a large exponent) given in the task description the approaching using a list will result in a large number of interations and zero values which is not efficient. By using a dictionary the need for this is removed. It is also a more intuitive data strucutre for inputing your coefficients and for reading them as output. "
