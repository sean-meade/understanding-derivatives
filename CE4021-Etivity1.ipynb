    "\n",
    "A polynomial is a mathematical equation consisting of variables and coefficients. A polynomial can have any number of coefficients and variables, and the variables can have any order of power that is a positive integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a polynomial: $ y(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x - 1 $\n",

    "#### Equation for Vertical Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomials are equations that can be used to describe linear processes. One specific one can describe an object being fired directly up into the air, also known as the \"equation for vertical motion\". For the sake of this example we will fire our ball from ground level within a vacuum (i.e. it is not effected by air currents, wind resistance etc). The equation for vertical motion is a polynomial that represents the vertical displacement ($ h $) as a function of time ($ t $) with respect to the initial velocity ($ V_{iy} $), and acceleration/deceleration due to gravity ($ g $).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    h(t) = V_{iy}t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differentiation of a polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "What if I wanted to find the velocity of the object ($ V_{y} $) at a time ($ t $)? Velocity is the change is distance (measured in meters m) divided by a change in time (measured in seconds s), or $ \\frac{m}{s} $). Our equation above gets the displacement for a given time. If we were to get the velocity between two points in time we could get the displacement at one time $ t $ subtract it from the displacement at another time a little further on $ \\delta t $ and divide it by the difference between the two times:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Velocity~between~t~and~t+\\delta t = \\frac{change~in~distance}{change~in~time} = \\frac{h(t~+~\\delta~t) - h(t)}{(t~+~\\delta~t) - t}~~or~~\\frac{h(t~+~\\delta~t) - h(t)}{\\delta~t}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the formula above we could get the velocity between any two points in time. When you think of velocity here it is the ratio (or slope tangent to the function when thinking it terms of points and lines on a graph) of $ h $ to $ t $ (or $ \\frac{h}{t} $). These two points on the graph of $ h(t) $ would be ($ t $, $ h(t) $) and ($ t~+~\\delta~t $, $ h(t~+~\\delta~t) $)\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative is defined as 'an instantaneous rate of change'. As pointed out in the [video by 3Blue1Brown on the topic](https://youtu.be/9vKqVkMQHKk?si=QGEQitIiNg3zORRg&t=30s), this is an oxymoron. \"Change is something that happens between separate points in time, and when you blind yourself to all but a single instant, there is no more room for change.\" For example if you wanted to get the velocity at 3 minutes (at an instant in time), and the velocity requires a measure of time to calculate it, then it really doesn't make sense at face value. This is saying that $ \\delta t $ would be zero so the equation above would some to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky we had some really smart people, the cool cats that founded calculus, that came up with an inspired solution here. For our example this instantaneous rate of change would be an 'instantaneous velocity'. It is the velocity at a single point (which again doesn't quite make sense). But what if you were to think of this change to happen at a $ \\delta~t $ that approaches zero ($ \\delta~t to zero $). Not is zero but forever gets closer and closer to zero. \n",

    "Write your reflection in below cell. With reference to the Rubric for E-tivity 1:\n",
    "### Provide an accurate description of your code with advantages and disadvantages of design choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first decided to read the task and the rubric and understand what was being asked of in the task. I saw a lot of discussion on the forum around using a string to represent an actual polynomial. I decided against this approach as (also mentioned in the discussions) the task asked for a symbolic input of a polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first choice was how to symbolically represent a polynomial. I knew that the hint in the task description, of using a list of only the coefficients and the position of that element as the power, would be fine for small order polynomials. However, as hint 2 suggested, it was impractical for higher orders. A possible answer came to me when reading Vaclav Krol post on using dictionaries. I knew I wanted to be able to have two terms with the same orders (as this is still a valid polynomial) and dictionaries didn't allow for this (sets also pose this same issue). However, I did like the idea of inputting both the coefficient and the power. The answer was then obvious to use either lists or tuples. Since processing these are the same in Python I decided to write my function to be able to handle either. It is only adding elements to either of these that sets them apart. This decision was cemented after reading posts and comments from Clarkes, Colemans, and Mitchs posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "I knew the output would be a list as a tuple is immutable but later I thought that you might want to return it as a tuple of tuples (as these are quicker to process). This is why I introduced the optional parameter return_tup_of_tups to my polynomial_differentiation function. It allows the user to decide what the output will be, although at the cost of taking longer to process. Below in the appendix I have done some time trials on the different inputs and edited my polynomial_differentiation function to handle dictionaries. Although dictionaries are faster (as expected because lookups are quicker for dictionaries) I decided for the flexibility of lists/tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the body of my function I was first looping through each term and grabbing the coefficients and powers directly. After Mohammed AlJaaidi pointed out in my post that a constant could also be represented by a list with only one element I changed this. It now checks each term and add the power as zero if this is the case, making my code more robust, so thank you Mohammed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the values are available I then check to see if the power is greater then zero. As a polynomial does not have negative powers. After one of the Q&As with Pep where he said that None could be entered also I check for this here too. I decided to treat None as an error and not as zero because there are many reasons for None to appear in Python. I then check to see if the coefficient is None. Either of these ends the function because a valid polynomial was not entered. This was a personal choice based on these attributes however I know Peter O'Mahony evaluates it as zero which allows the function to succeed more as it is less strict.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last check is to see if either the coefficient or the power are zero. If this is the case it uses pass and moves on to the next term of the polynomial, as this will be treated as zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these checks slow down the function (although arguably negligibly) but make the function more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I perform the power rule on the term and add it to the output list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all elements of the input are looped through I return the differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compare your approach to alternative (peer) approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above many solutions use string parsing to end up with their symbolic polynomial before differentiating. Although it is an interesting approach, neither the task or the rubric asked for this so I decided against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between solutions is the choice of input. This is all down to personal choice. Some like Phil Clarke, Deventhiran Ranganathan, Vaclav Krol, and Liam Mulcahy used dictionaries, opting for speed over flexibility. Some like Bartlomiej Mlynarkiewicz, Mitchell DeBruyn, Godfrey Jeremiah, and Aurelie Montfrond used a list to represent coefficients and the position of the element then would represent the power. This is great for small order polynomials but the higher order you go the more inefficient it gets. Pierce Currid, Julieta Rubis, and I used similar approaches with a combination of lists or tuples inside a list or tuples. I haven't fully gone through the others code enough to confirm but I suspect any combination of lists and tuples will work with their solution. Jason Coleman uses a combination of a set and tuples for space-efficiency although I don't know how these match up in comparison to dictionaries or just tuple of tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose flexibility over all else. The tests in the Appendix show there is not much in the difference for the speed and I didn't think space was a factor for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second difference after input is how to evaluate the input for potential problems. I like many others have checked for less the zero values for the exponential. There is possibility to have the function work for negatives but I decided to be strict in my approach to only differentiate polynomials. At the time of writing this I have found no other solution that checks for None values in the symbolic polynomial, I added this (as stated earlier) after one of the Q&A sessions where Pep mentions it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clearly describe how you have used your peers' work/input and how this has affected your own understanding / insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although I was describing the theory behind differentiation of a polynomial and using the power rule in my function I realised after looking through Jason Colemans and Mitchell DeBruyns notebooks that I had not described the power rule. Thanks to them there is not a connection to what is used in the function and the theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As mentioned earlier Vaclav Krol made me consider dictionaries as a choice of input. Along with posts/comments from Mitchell DeBruyn and Jason Coleman these helped me cement my decision of a list of lists or a tuple of tuples.\n",
