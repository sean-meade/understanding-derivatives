    "\n",
    "*The first one to symbolically calculate the derivative of a polynomial with one variable. The input should be a polynomial and the output should also be a polynomial.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The second one to evaluate (i.e. get the numerical value) of a polynomial for a given value of its variable. The input should be a polynomial and a value (point at which to evaluate the polynomial). The output should be a scalar.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Test your code with a few salient polynomials (minimum of 3) for which you have calculated the derivative of these polynomials manually.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial thoughts:\n",
    "Split it into subtasks\n",
    "1. handle input of equation\n",
    "2. differentiate the input\n",
    "3. display the resulting prettified input and output\n",
    "4. handle input of variable value\n",
    "5. calculate the result\n",
    "6. display resulting scalar\n",
    "7. display a set of test results\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures I am considering are lists and tuples.\n",
    "I want to maximise the flexibility of the solution so I will ask the user to specify the powers rather than determine them impicitly from the order of the coefficients.\n",
